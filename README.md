# What is this?
This is a repo for helpful scripts, and (hopefully) useful resources for learning JsMacros. 

Currently all scripts are JavaScript, and will probably stay that way. I am using this to help learn basic JavaScript outside of a web dev context.

## What is this for?
These scripts were made and intended to be used on [CivMc](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/) minecraft server. Scripts were made to follow the [rules](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Botting#Botting_Rules) on said server. 

## Rules
The main rules are as follows:
- Bots are allowed to read any inventory, their selected hot bar slot, their own location, their health, their hunger, their potion effects, their EXP, their boss bar, chat messages, kick reasons, player logins/logouts, the tab list and nothing else
- Reading environmental data in particular is not allowed. This includes the location of any entities and any blocks.
- Bots can only read server provided chat messages, not ones generated by client side mods.
- Bots and scripts may not be used to directly help a player fight during combat.
These scripts will follow these rules. If you find any that don't, please tell me using contact info below.

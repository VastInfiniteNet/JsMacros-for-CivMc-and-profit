# What is this?
This is a repo for helpful scripts, and (hopefully) useful resources for learning JsMacros. 

Currently most scripts are JavaScript. I am using this to help learn basic JavaScript outside of a web dev context.

I am in the process of learning about TypeScript and will probably *slowly* transition all scripts being primiarly written in TS and having a JS verison as well.

## What is this for?
These scripts were made and intended to be used on [CivMc](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/) minecraft server. Scripts were made to follow the [rules](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Botting#Botting_Rules) on said server. 

## Why is this?
I find scripts like these to be generally beneficial to the experience of playing on CivMc, so as long as bots are allowed, I will play around with them. 

The most valuable resource on CivMc is time, scripts are one way to be more effiecent with it.

## How do I use this?
[Download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jsmacros) and install [JsMacros](https://jsmacros.wagyourtail.xyz/?/general.html). There is a very basic, of little use ["tutorial"](https://jsmacros.wagyourtail.xyz/?/tutorial.html). You want to put the scripts in your path/to/instance/config/jsMacros/Macros/scripts folder and then bind the scripts to events, keys, or add as a service. You can always try to contact me using the info listed below. I personally have used the documentation and github source code to solve most my problems. If that doesn't help, try the [JsMacros discord](https://discord.com/invite/P6W58J8).

## Contribute?
If you are interested in contributing, feel free to make a PR to add a script! There are certainly mainly bugs, so feel free to help fix them or tell me about them!

## Rules
The main rules are as follows:
- Bots are allowed to read any inventory, their selected hot bar slot, their own location, their health, their hunger, their potion effects, their EXP, their boss bar, chat messages, kick reasons, player logins/logouts, the tab list and nothing else
- Reading environmental data in particular is not allowed. This includes the location of any entities and any blocks.
- Bots can only read server provided chat messages, not ones generated by client side mods.
- Bots and scripts may not be used to directly help a player fight during combat.

These scripts will follow these rules. If you find any that don't, please tell me using contact info below.

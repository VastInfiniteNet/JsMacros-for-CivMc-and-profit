# What is this?
Will automatically replace any tool that breaks or block that runs in your hand. Must have an equivalent item/block in your inventory. 

Makes mining more seemless!

It is against the rules on CivMc to use this for any purposes related to pvp. This includes swords, and potions replacement. I am working on excluding these items from being replacable.

### TODO LIST
- [X] Don't run while inventory is open
- [ ] Enchant equivalency options
- [X] Don't replace swords
- [X] Don't replace potions
